# Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract

This project implements a variety of reinforcement learning algorithms to find policies for the [Frozen Lake](https://martin-ueding.de/posts/reinforcement-learning-frozen-lake/) environment. The output of the various algorithms is located in the `output.txt` file.

## Setup & Run

* Ensure to have the following dependency installed: 
    - `NumPy`
* For the Small Lake environment, navigate to the root folder, open a terminal and run: `python ./code/5_main.py` 
* For the Big Lake environment, navigate to the root folder, open a terminal and run: 
    - `python ./code/6_main_big_lake.py` 
* The output should be displayed on the terminal and will be saved as a `.txt` file in the same folder
