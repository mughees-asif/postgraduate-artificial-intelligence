# ECS759P Artificial Intelligence: Coursework 2

## Logic and Reasoning, Neural Networks and Classification

### Abstract

The saved notebook displays the development, training and testing of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify between different items of clothing. The model is trained using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The final train and test accuracy were found to be  97%  and  89% , respectively. Additionally, various parameters including the learning rate, activation functions, and dropout layers were modified/added to observe the behaviour of the model.

### Dependencies

Please ensure to install the following dependencies before executing the notebook:

- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
