## Advanced Robotics Systems

### Overview
The main objective of this module is to provide students with the required skills to program complex robotic systems in a flexible and robust way. The module brielfy reviews basic concepts of robot kinematics and control (already presented in the previous years of the QMUL UG Robotics Engineering programme) and then introduces new and advanced concepts related to robot path and trajectory planning, machine learning, robot vision, bio-inspired and cognitive robotics. It discusses advanced applications of robots in both structured and unstructured environments: industry, challenging environments (e.g. nuclear, space, deep sea), civil inspections, search and rescue, healthcare and public/social spaces. It introduces the importance of applying multidisciplinary techniques to enhance the current state of the art in Robotics Engineering and it allows the students to explore creative and engineered solutions that are outside the box (e.g. inspired by biological systems) alongside conventional applications and standard software and computational tools (e.g. ROS - the Robot Operating System).
