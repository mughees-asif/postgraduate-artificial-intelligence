## Computational Creativity

### Overview
Computational creativity is the philosophy, science and engineering of intelligent systems which take on creative responsibilities - tasks like music composition, game design, fiction writing, mathematical discovery, writing rap lyrics, or providing thoughtful critique of an artwork. Its practitioners work at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, building assistive tools and autonomous systems, inspired by work both in computer science as well as allied fields like psychology, sociology, and many creative practices.
