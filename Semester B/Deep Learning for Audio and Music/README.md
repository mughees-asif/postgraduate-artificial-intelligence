## Deep Learning for Audio and Music

### Overview
This module focuses on deep learning methods and how they can be used to address typical tasks in audio and music. It aims to provide students with advanced training in deep learning for analysis and synthesis of music (audio/symbolic) and other forms of audio data. It covers key theoretical components and principles of modern deep neural networks (DNNs), including training of common DNN types as well as modifying DNNs for new purposes. Various tasks in analysis/generation of audio and music are studied to inspire the content. Background in machine learning is essential, and some background in digital signal processing is highly recommended. Music knowledge is desirable but not a requirement.
