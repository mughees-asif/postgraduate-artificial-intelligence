## Information Retrieval

### Overview

The field of information retrieval (IR) aims to provide techniques and tools to support
effective and efficient access to large amounts of textual information
(e.g. stored on the web, digital libraries, intranets).
This course will describe the IR field in details, both its theoretical and empirical aspects.

The following topics will be covered: 

Indexing: Representing the information content of documents through the use of free-text,
controlled vocabulary, and semantic data models.

Retrieval: Models that select which information objects are relevant to a user's need.
This includes: Boolean model, vector space model, probabilistic models, language models,
inference networks, and relevance feedback models.
 
Evaluation: Implementing and evaluating IR models, mainly with respect to effectiveness aspects. 

Retrieval tasks: Ad-hoc retrieval, classification, and summarisation.

Special topics/applications such as image retrieval and logical IR.
