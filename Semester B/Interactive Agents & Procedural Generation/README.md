## Interactive Agents and Procedural Generation

### Overview
Modern video games employ various agents that interact with the player as opponents or characters, and that generate new content.  This module covers the broad range of computational approaches developers currently use to create these in-game agents.  The first part deals with techniques for authoring agent behaviour for games. The second part explores approaches for procedural content generation of environments, narrative and others forms of game content.
