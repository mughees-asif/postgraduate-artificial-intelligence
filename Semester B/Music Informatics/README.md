## Music Informatics

### Overview

This module introduces students to state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of music data, with a focus on music audio. It presents in-depth studies of general approaches to the low-level analysis of audio signals, and follows these with specialised methods for the high-level analysis of music signals, including the extraction of information related to the rhythm, melody, harmony, form and instrumentation of recorded music. This is followed by an examination of the most important methods of extracting high-level musical content, sound source separation, and on analysing multimodal music data.
