## Neural Networks and NLP

### Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become one of the most important technologies in Artificial Intelligence. Automatic methods for processing natural language now  find application in almost every aspect of our communication in person or online, in particular through  social media.  The increased use of Neural Networks has played an important role in the most recent progress of NLP, as NN techniques have delivered improved performance in applications ranging from language modelling (next word prediction) to speech to machine translation to sentiment analysis. This module provides a thorough introduction to this cutting-edge  approach to developing NLP systems.
